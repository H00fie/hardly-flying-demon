# Hardly Flying Demon
A game in which the player has to help demon Halikal escape from hell after sort of disappointing Belial. Halikal, being the demon of common sense, doesn't really look foward to meeting his former master head-on anytime soon.

The main problem is, Belial has revoked Halikal's Permit of the Unholy which means that touching basically anything in hell will be lethal for Halikal.

Halikal needs to navigate his way out of ever-changing chaotic landscape of hell making sure he reaches the black portals without interacting with anything on the way.

His situation is particularly tricky as flying has never been his strongest suit and he's always had problems controlling his movements mid-air.
